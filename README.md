Content Functionality
=====================

Simple design that allows users to click on buttons in order to see gifs from the giphy website.

Users may choose the number of gifs they wish to see or leave it blank and get the default of ten gifs per click.

Each time a new button is clicked the previous gifs are replaced with the new ones.

The user has the ability to add a new button of their choosing.
